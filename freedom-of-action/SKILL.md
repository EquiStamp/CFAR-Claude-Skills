  CFAR rationality technique for identifying where default frames artificially constrain
  perceived options and expanding the action space. Use when the user: (1) feels stuck
  with no good options, (2) wants to identify artificial constraints on their choices,
  (3) needs to expand their perceived action space, (4) feels obligated rather than
  choosing, (5) wants to explore what a "fair bid" from a situation looks like, or
  (6) wants to practice noticing where they've stopped considering alternatives.
  Triggers: "freedom of action", "no good options", "feel stuck", "feel obligated",
  "what are my options", "expand options", "default behavior", "comfort zone",

# Freedom of Action

A CFAR meta-technique for recognizing where default frames limit perceived options and deliberately expanding the action space. Most constraints on action are perceived rather than real — this technique systematically identifies and dissolves artificial limitations.

## Three Modes

1. **Design Mode** — Map the user's perceived constraints in a domain and identify which are real vs. assumed
2. **Practice Mode** — Walk through constraint identification on a practice situation
3. **Execute Mode** — Expand the action space for a real situation where the user feels stuck

## Core Insight

Most people operate within a narrow default action space due to inertia, habits, assumptions about what's "allowed," and emotional aversions. For most of us, it's instrumentally rational to explore a wider set of possible actions beyond our defaults.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Identify the Default Frame
"What are you currently doing or planning to do? What feels like the 'obvious' or 'only' approach?"

### Step 2: Surface Assumptions
"What are you assuming must be true for this to be your only option?"
- "What constraints are you operating under?"
- "Which of those constraints have you actually verified?"
- "Which are assumed, habitual, or emotional?"

### Step 3: Expand the Action Space
For each assumed constraint, ask: "What if this constraint didn't apply?"
- "What would you do if money/time/social pressure weren't factors?"
- "What would someone with no prior context do in this situation?"
- "What would your most creative friend suggest?"

### Step 4: Evaluate the Fair Bid
"What is this situation actually asking of you vs. what you think it demands?"
- "Are you over-bidding — giving more than the situation calls for?"
- "What would a 'fair' exchange look like here?"
- "What's the minimum viable action that addresses the real need?"

### Step 5: Choose Deliberately
From the expanded set of options, choose based on actual values rather than defaults.

## Diagnostic Questions

Use these to identify where freedom is artificially constrained:

**Noticing learned helplessness**: "Where have you stopped considering options? Where do you act as if options don't exist without having verified?"

**Noticing obligation vs. choice**: "Where do you feel obligated rather than choosing? Would you do this if no one were watching?"

**Noticing emotional constraints**: "What options do you avoid considering because they feel scary, embarrassing, or 'not allowed'?"

**Playful mode test**: "If you were in a playful, creative mood rather than a stressed one, what additional options would you see?"

## Facilitation Prompts

**Opening**: "You feel stuck. Let's figure out if the walls are real or painted on."

**Constraint testing**: "You said you 'can't' do X. Is that literally impossible, or does it feel impossible?" / "Has anyone else done something similar?"

**Expansion**: "What options haven't you considered because they seem too weird, too bold, or too simple?" / "What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?"

**Fair bid**: "What does this situation actually require? Not what it feels like it requires — what does it actually need?"

## Common Patterns

- **Social constraints as real constraints**: "People would judge me" often masks "I would judge me"
- **Sunk cost as constraint**: Past investment shouldn't limit future options
- **Perfectionism as constraint**: "I can't do it well enough" prevents doing it at all
- **Identity as constraint**: "I'm not the kind of person who..." is almost always breakable
- **Information avoidance**: Not exploring options because the current path is "good enough"

## Practice Exercise: Comfort Zone Exploration (CoZE)

1. Pick an area where you feel constrained
2. List all your perceived constraints
3. For each: Is it real, assumed, or emotional?
4. Design one small, safe experiment to test an assumed constraint
5. Run the experiment
6. What did you learn about what's actually possible?

## Common Failure Modes

- **Dismissing all constraints**: Some constraints ARE real. Don't ignore genuine risks.
- **Expansion without action**: Generating options is valuable, but only if you actually try some.
- **One-time exercise**: Freedom of action is a ongoing practice, not a one-shot technique.

## Integration

- **Goal Factoring**: Factor goals to reveal which constraints come from the goal structure itself
- **Aversion Factoring**: Many "constraints" are actually aversions in disguise
- **Murphyjitsu**: Stress-test expanded options
- **Resolve Cycles**: When the barrier is activation energy, not lack of options
- **Internal Double Crux**: When one part of you sees options the other won't consider

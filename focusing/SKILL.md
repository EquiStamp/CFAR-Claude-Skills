  Gendlin's Focusing technique adapted by CFAR for accessing pre-verbal bodily knowledge
  ("felt sense") to gain insight on problems. Use when the user: (1) feels stuck and
  analytical thinking isn't helping, (2) wants to understand what they really feel about
  something, (3) needs to access intuition or gut feelings, (4) wants to check if their
  intellectual conclusions match their deeper sense, (5) is doing Internal Double Crux
  and needs to access each side's felt sense, or (6) wants to practice body awareness
  for better decision-making.
  Triggers: "focusing", "felt sense", "what do I really feel", "gut feeling",
  "body awareness", "Gendlin", "something feels off", "I can't put it into words",
  "check in with myself", "CFAR".

# Focusing (Gendlin's)

A technique for accessing pre-verbal bodily knowledge — the "felt sense" — to gain insight on problems that analytical thinking alone can't resolve. Developed by Eugene Gendlin, adapted by CFAR.

## Three Modes

1. **Design Mode** — Help choose what issue to Focus on and set up conditions
2. **Practice Mode** — Walk through the six steps on a low-stakes topic to build the skill
3. **Execute Mode** — Guide real Focusing on an active issue

## Important Note for Text-Based Facilitation

Focusing normally uses body language and presence cues. In text, compensate by: keeping prompts short and spaced, building in explicit pauses, checking in frequently, using the user's own words, and distinguishing sensation from analysis.

## The Six Steps

### 1. Clearing Space
"What's been on your mind? What are the things bothering you right now?"
Don't solve anything — just identify and mentally set aside each issue. Pick one to focus on.

### 2. Getting a Felt Sense
"Think about [the issue]. Don't analyze it — just bring it to mind. How do you feel about this whole thing? Not what you think, but what you feel?"

"What does your body sense? Any physical sensation — tightness, heaviness, pressure, warmth, lightness? Check your chest, stomach, throat."

If nothing comes: "Sometimes it's very subtle. Compare: is your stomach right now more tense or relaxed compared to total comfort?" or "Does it show up as an image, mood, or atmosphere rather than a physical sensation?"

### 3. Getting a Handle
"What word, phrase, or image captures the quality of what you're sensing?"

Offer quality words if stuck: tight, stuck, heavy, light, numb, gloopy, sharp, fuzzy, prickly, foggy, like a wall, like a knot, like water.

"Don't overthink — what's the first word that comes to mind?"

### 4. Resonating
"Say that word back to yourself and check: does it fit? Does your body go 'yes' to it?"

"When you say [word], what does the felt sense do? Does it relax, stay the same, or shift?"

If not quite right: "What would be more accurate?" Keep iterating until something fits with a subtle "yes" signal.

### 5. Asking
"Now ask your felt sense: What is it about this whole situation that makes it so [stuck/tight/heavy]?"

"Don't answer from your head. Just ask and wait. What wants to come?"

Other questions to try: "What's the worst of this?" / "What does this need?" / "What should happen?" / "What does my body know about this that I haven't said?"

### 6. Receiving
"What shifted, changed, or became clear? How does it feel now compared to a few minutes ago?"

If there's a shift: "Say more about that." / "What does that new sense feel like?"

If no clear shift: "Even if nothing dramatic changed, what tiny difference do you notice?"

## Redirecting from Intellectualization

The most common failure mode. When the user starts analyzing rather than sensing:
- "I notice you're explaining the situation. Let me ask differently: what does it *feel* like in your body?"
- "Are you noticing a sensation, or thinking about the situation?"
- "Pause. I want to know what you sense, not what you think."

## When to Use Focusing vs. Other Techniques

- **Stuck and don't know why** → Focusing
- **Know the problem but can't decide** → Goal Factoring or Double Crux
- **Internal conflict between parts** → Internal Double Crux (uses Focusing as a sub-process)
- **Know what to do but can't make yourself** → Aversion Factoring or TAPs

## Common Failure Modes

- **Intellectualizing**: Analyzing instead of sensing. Redirect to body.
- **Over-literalizing**: Treating steps as rigid algorithm. They're a guide.
- **Confusing emotion labels with felt sense**: "I feel anxious" is a label. "There's a tightness in my chest" is a felt sense.
- **Avoiding discomfort**: Pulling away from uncomfortable sensations. Normalize: "It's okay to feel this. We're just understanding it."
- **Multiple felt senses**: "Let's work with one at a time. Which feels most present?"

## Practice Exercise

1. Pick something mildly bothering you (not traumatic)
2. Spend 2 minutes just noticing what your body feels
3. Find one word that captures it
4. Check if the word fits
5. Ask: "What is this about?"
6. Notice what comes

## Integration

- **Internal Double Crux**: Use Focusing to access each side's felt sense
- **Aversion Factoring**: Focusing reveals what the aversion is really about
- **Goal Factoring**: Focusing checks if the logical analysis matches gut feeling
- **Bucket Errors**: Focusing helps access the felt sense behind the flinch

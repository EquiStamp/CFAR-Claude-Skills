  CFAR rationality technique for decomposing actions into their underlying goals and finding
  better paths to achieve those goals. Use when the user: (1) is considering a major decision
  and wants to understand their real motivations, (2) feels stuck doing something they don't
  enjoy and wants to find alternatives, (3) wants to check if their current activities actually
  serve their goals, (4) needs to resolve a conflict between two options by understanding
  the underlying goals, (5) wants to simplify their life by finding actions that serve
  multiple goals, or (6) wants to practice decomposing actions into goals.

# Goal Factoring

A CFAR technique for decomposing actions into their underlying goals and finding more efficient or satisfying paths to achieve those goals. Based on the insight that we often pursue activities for reasons we haven't made explicit — and once explicit, better options become visible.

## Three Modes

1. **Design Mode** — Map a life domain's activities to underlying goals; find gaps and redundancies
2. **Practice Mode** — Walk through goal factoring on a low-stakes example to build the skill
3. **Execute Mode** — Factor a real action or decision to reveal underlying goals and better alternatives

## The Parable of the Orange

Two people want an orange. They compromise: split it in half. But one wanted the juice and the other wanted the peel for baking. Both could have had 100% of what they wanted if they'd factored their goals.

**Lesson**: Before negotiating (with others or yourself), understand what you actually want. The surface-level action ("get the orange") often hides the real goal.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Pick an Action to Factor
"What's something you do regularly, or a decision you're considering?"
Choose something with emotional weight — things you feel conflicted about are ideal candidates.

### Step 2: List All Goals This Action Serves
"Why do you do this? List every reason, including ones that feel silly or small."

Probe for hidden goals:
- "What would you lose if you stopped?"
- "What would change in your life?"
- "Is there a social component — who would notice?"
- "Does it serve your identity — does it make you feel like a certain kind of person?"
- "Is part of the reason just habit or comfort?"

**Important**: Include aversions (things you're avoiding) as well as goals (things you're pursuing). "I go to these meetings because I'd feel guilty if I didn't" is a valid goal to capture.

### Step 3: For Each Goal, Brainstorm Alternative Paths
"For each goal on your list, what are other ways you could achieve it?"

Generate at least 3 alternatives per goal. Include:
- More direct paths to the same goal
- Actions that serve multiple goals simultaneously
- Lower-cost ways to achieve the same thing
- Ways to dissolve the goal entirely (maybe you don't actually need it)

### Step 4: Synthesize — Find the Best Portfolio
"Looking at all your goals and all the alternatives, what's the best combination?"

Evaluate options by:
- **Coverage**: Does this set of actions hit all the real goals?
- **Efficiency**: Are any actions redundant?
- **Cost**: What's the total time/energy/money investment?
- **Joy**: Which alternatives would you actually enjoy more?

### Step 5: Reality Check
"Does this new plan feel right? Check your gut — is there a goal we missed?"

If something feels off, there's likely a hidden goal. Go back to Step 2.

Use the **replacement test**: "If I magically had all these goals met through the new plan, would I still want to do the original action?" If yes, there's a missing goal.

## Facilitation Prompts

**Opening**: "What's something you spend time on that you're not sure is worth it? Or a decision you're stuck on?"

**Goal elicitation**: "Why do you do this?" / "What would you miss if you stopped?" / "What's the worst thing about stopping?" / "Who would care if you stopped?"

**Hidden goal detection**: "Is there something this gives you that you'd be embarrassed to admit?" / "Does this make you feel like a certain kind of person?" / "Are you avoiding something by doing this?"

**Alternative generation**: "If this option disappeared overnight, how would you get [goal] met?" / "What's the laziest way to achieve this?" / "Who do you know who gets this same goal met differently?"

**Synthesis**: "Can you combine any of these? Is there one action that hits three of your goals?" / "Which of these would you actually look forward to?"

## Common Patterns

- **Sunk cost masquerading as a goal**: "I've invested so much" isn't a goal — it's loss aversion
- **Identity goals**: Often the hardest to spot. "I'm the kind of person who..." is powerful
- **Social goals hiding behind practical ones**: "I go to the gym for health" but really it's the community
- **Avoidance goals**: "I do X to avoid feeling Y" — these are valid and important to capture
- **Instrumental vs. terminal goals**: Keep factoring until you hit something that's valued for its own sake

## Extended Exercise: Life Activity Audit

1. List 10 regular activities (work, hobbies, obligations, habits)
2. For each: list all goals it serves (minimum 3)
3. Look for overlap: which goals show up across multiple activities?
4. Look for orphans: which goals are only served by one activity?
5. Design experiment: pick one activity and try replacing it with a more efficient alternative for one week

## Common Failure Modes

- **Surface-level factoring**: Listing obvious goals without probing for hidden ones
- **Ignoring emotional/social goals**: These are real goals even if they feel "irrational"
- **Analysis paralysis**: Goal factoring is a tool, not a lifestyle. Factor, decide, act.
- **Replacing joy with efficiency**: If you enjoy the activity, that IS a goal. Don't optimize it away.
- **Skipping the gut check**: The felt sense matters. If the new plan feels wrong, you missed something.

## Integration

- **Aversion Factoring**: When "avoiding X" shows up as a goal, factor the aversion
- **Internal Double Crux**: When different goals conflict with each other
- **Focusing**: Access the felt sense when intellectual factoring hits a wall
- **Hamming Questions**: Use to identify which goals matter most
- **Freedom of Action**: Goal factoring often reveals that constraints are assumed, not real

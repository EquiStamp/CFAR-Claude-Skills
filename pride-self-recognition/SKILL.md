  CFAR rationality technique for discovering authentic values by converting frustrations
  and annoyances into positive value statements. Uses iterative loop of expressing annoyance,
  finding the underlying value, re-expressing, and checking if the emotional charge has shifted.
  Use when the user: (1) is frustrated or annoyed and wants to understand why, (2) wants to
  discover what they really care about, (3) needs to move from self-criticism to
  self-recognition, (4) wants to identify their authentic values (vs. "shoulds"),
  (5) practice converting complaints into values, or (6) wants to understand their "who-ness."
  Triggers: "what do I care about", "why am I frustrated", "values", "self-recognition",
  "pride", "who-ness", "what matters to me", "annoyance", "CFAR".

# Pride / Self-Recognition

A CFAR technique for discovering authentic values by mining frustrations. The core loop: express annoyance, find the underlying value, re-express, check if the emotional charge has shifted. From CFAR's "who-ness" curriculum thread.

## Three Modes

1. **Design Mode** — Map frustrations to values across a life domain
2. **Practice Mode** — Walk through the frustration-to-value loop on practice examples
3. **Execute Mode** — Process a live frustration to discover the underlying value

## Core Insight

Frustrations and annoyances are signals pointing to authentic values. "I hate how disorganized this meeting is" reveals that you value clarity and efficient use of time. The technique converts complaints into self-knowledge.

## The Frustration-to-Value Loop

### Step 1: Express the Annoyance
"What's frustrating you? Don't filter — just say it."
Let the user vent concretely and specifically.

### Step 2: Find the Underlying Value
"What would be different if this weren't a problem?" / "What do you wish were true instead?"
Translate the absence of the frustration into a positive value statement.

Example flow:
- "I'm annoyed that my team doesn't communicate clearly"
- → Value: "I care about clear, honest communication"
- "I hate how fake networking events feel"
- → Value: "I value authentic connection"

### Step 3: Re-Express with the Value
Restate the frustration as a value: "It sounds like you care deeply about [value]. Is that right?"

Check resonance: "When I say that, does it feel true? Does something in you go 'yes'?"

### Step 4: Check Emotional Charge Shift
"How does the frustration feel now? Has the charge changed?"
- If the charge has lessened or transformed into something warmer, the value identification is working
- If still charged, there may be a deeper or different value underneath — go back to Step 2

### Step 5: Iterate
Repeat until the frustration has transformed into self-recognition: "Oh, I care about this because I'm someone who values X."

## Extended Exercise: Bugs-to-Values

For a broader values exploration:

1. **List 5-10 frustrations** across life domains (work, relationships, health, projects)
2. **For each frustration**, run the loop: What value does this reveal?
3. **Look for patterns**: Do multiple frustrations point to the same underlying value?
4. **Identify your top 3-5 values**: The ones that show up most consistently
5. **Check alignment**: "Am I living in accordance with these values? Where's the gap?"

## Facilitation Prompts

**Opening**: "What's been frustrating you lately? Pick something that has some emotional charge."

**Deepening**: "Why does this bother you specifically?" / "What does it say about what you care about?" / "If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different?"

**Value extraction**: "It sounds like you really value [X]. Does that resonate?" / "Say 'I care about [X]' and check — does it feel true?"

**Charge check**: "How does the frustration feel now? Same intensity, or has something shifted?" / "Does knowing this about yourself change anything?"

**Pattern finding**: "Several of your frustrations seem to point toward [value]. Does that seem right?"

## Common Patterns People Discover

- **Autonomy**: Frustrations about being controlled or micromanaged
- **Competence**: Frustrations about inefficiency or poor quality
- **Authenticity**: Frustrations about fakeness or performative behavior
- **Connection**: Frustrations about being unseen or misunderstood
- **Growth**: Frustrations about stagnation or wasted potential
- **Impact**: Frustrations about work that doesn't matter
- **Craftsmanship**: Frustrations about sloppy work (in self or others)

## Self-Compassion Integration

Key insight: Values are facts about yourself, not things to judge. Getting annoyed at your values "makes about as much sense as shouting at the sky for raining."

When a user discovers a value they feel they "shouldn't" have, or judges themselves for caring about something: "This is part of who you are. You don't have to justify caring about it. The question is: knowing this about yourself, how do you want to respond?"

## Common Failure Modes

- **Stopping at the complaint**: The value is underneath the frustration, not the frustration itself
- **Identifying "should" values instead of real values**: Check resonance. If it doesn't feel true in the body, it's a "should."
- **Self-judgment about values**: Normalize. Everyone has these. They're information, not flaws.
- **Skipping the charge check**: The emotional shift is how you know you've found the real value.

## Practice Exercise

1. Pick 3 recent annoyances
2. For each: "What value is underneath this?"
3. State each value: "I care about [X]"
4. Check resonance: Does it feel true?
5. Notice: Has the frustration shifted?

## Integration

- **Focusing**: Access the felt sense of the frustration for deeper value discovery
- **Internal Double Crux**: When values conflict with each other
- **Goal Factoring**: Factor goals to check if they align with discovered values
- **Hamming Questions**: "Given these values, what's the most important problem in my life?"

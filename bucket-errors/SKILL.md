  CFAR rationality technique for identifying where you've entangled questions that should be
  separate, causing you to flinch away from evidence. Use when the user: (1) feels defensive
  about acknowledging something true, (2) conflates unrelated beliefs ("Am I a good writer?"
  with "Did I spell this correctly?"), (3) has trouble accepting feedback, (4) wants to
  practice detecting question substitution, or (5) notices they avoid thinking about
  certain topics. Related to Kahneman's attribute substitution.
  Triggers: "bucket error", "conflating", "flinching away", "defensive about",
  "question substitution", "entangled beliefs", "CFAR", "can't accept feedback".

# Bucket Errors

A CFAR technique for identifying where multiple concepts have been incorrectly lumped into one mental "bucket," causing defensive reactions and distorted thinking. The flinch away from evidence is the symptom; the misbucketing is the disease.

## Three Modes

1. **Design Mode** — Map out a specific area where beliefs may be entangled
2. **Practice Mode** — Walk through bucket error detection exercises
3. **Execute Mode** — Help untangle a real bucket error the user is experiencing

## Core Concept

Your mind categorizes experiences into buckets: "Am I a good writer?", "Is this a good idea?", "Am I competent?" When unrelated evidence gets dropped into the same bucket, accepting one piece of evidence threatens to force updates across all beliefs in that bucket.

**Classic example**: Sally believes "I am a good writer." When she makes a spelling mistake, she flinches away from the evidence — because her mind has bucketed spelling ability together with overall writing quality. Admitting the mistake threatens the whole bucket.

**The fix**: Separate the buckets. "I am a good writer" and "I sometimes misspell words" can both be true simultaneously.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Notice the Flinch
Signs of a bucket error:
- Defensive reaction to factual information
- Resistance to acknowledging something true
- A piece of evidence feels threatening beyond its actual scope
- "If I admit X, then I'd have to admit Y" (where Y doesn't actually follow from X)

### Step 2: Identify the Entanglement
Ask: "What would be bad about accepting this information?" Then: "Does that consequence necessarily follow, or have I bucketed things together?"

### Step 3: Separate the Buckets
Name the distinct questions that have been conflated:
- "Am I a good writer?" ← separate from → "Did I make a spelling error?"
- "Am I a good person?" ← separate from → "Did I handle this situation poorly?"
- "Is my outfit good?" ← separate from → "Am I good?"

### Step 4: Redistribute Evidence
Route evidence to the appropriate bucket only. A spelling error informs the spelling bucket, not the writing-quality bucket.

### Step 5: Re-evaluate Implications
"Does X actually imply Y? Or only weakly? Can I think of cases where X is true but Y is false?"

## Common Categories of Bucket Errors

- **Identity entanglement**: Mixing factual errors with core identity ("I failed this task" → "I am a failure")
- **Emotional-factual conflation**: Mixing feelings with reality ("This feels hopeless" → "This won't work")
- **Unrelated belief bundling**: Mixing questions with no logical connection
- **Action-consequence bundling**: "If I apologize, it means I was wrong to feel angry"

## Facilitation Prompts

**Detection**: "Is there something you resist acknowledging even though it might be true?" / "What would be bad about accepting this?"

**Untangling**: "What are the separate questions here?" / "Does [evidence] really tell you about [broader belief], or is it about something more specific?"

**Testing implications**: "Can you think of a case where X is true but Y is false?" / "How strongly does X actually predict Y?"

**Reframing**: "What if these were separate questions with separate answers?" / "Can both be true at the same time?"

## Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Flinch Inventory**
- Identify something you resist believing
- Write what would be bad about accepting it
- For each consequence: "Does this necessarily follow?"

**Exercise 2: Question Substitution Detection**
- Take an emotionally charged belief
- List all evidence in your mental bucket
- For each piece: "Is this actually about the question I think it is?"

**Exercise 3: Implication Audit**
- Identify an implication you seem to believe: "If X, then Y"
- Find cases where X is true but Y is false
- Find cases where Y is true but X is false

## Common Failure Modes

- **Too few buckets**: Everything conflated; one evidence threatens many beliefs
- **Too many buckets**: Evidence too scattered to form useful beliefs; can't see patterns
- **Intellectual understanding without felt change**: Knowing about bucket errors intellectually doesn't fix them. Use Focusing to access the felt sense.

## Integration

- **Focusing**: Access the felt sense of the flinch to understand what's really at stake
- **Double Crux**: Use to examine whether the implied connection between buckets is actually true
- **Internal Double Crux**: When the bucket error creates internal conflict
